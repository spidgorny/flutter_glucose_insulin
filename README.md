Motto: Eat what you want, just make a break.

It's known that in order to lose weight one has to lower the insulin level in the blood. Insulin prevents your body to use the fat as an energy source. The easiest way to lower insulin level is to stop eating for some time.

It can be hard though to remember when did you last eat and how much. This app can help you with the tracking. Enter when you eat and how much and it will show you the approximate estimated insulin level in your blood.

The insulin level shown is very approximate and unscientific! This app is not meant to measure insulin level precisely, but to help you make larger breaks between the meals.
